### Warm Up

 ### Q0.1

Write a function named **printAsTime** which takes hours, minutes, and seconds as three integers, 
then prints it to the screen as shown in the examples. 

    This function shouldn't return anything. 
     Assume no invalid input will be given (like 92 minutes or -2 hours). 
 
 | INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 5 12 3 | 05:12:03 | 
| 3 0 22     |  03:00:22 |  

 ### Q0.2

Write a function named **factorial** that takes an integer as a parameter and computes and **returns** the factorial of that integer.

Write a program to compute  the summation of each digits' factorial using factorial function. 


| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 4 | 24 | 
| 3     |  6 | 
| 43     | 30| 


### Q1

Write a function that will take an integer N, and returns **T** if it's a perfect number. Otherwise the function should return **F**. 

    Perfect Number: a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. 

     Then write main appropriately to see the result.
 
 | INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 27 | F | 
| 28     |  T | 


### Q2

Write a function that will take two integers, a number and N. Then reverse number's last N digits. 

    input: 176, 2
    output: 167
    
    input: 63712, 3
    output: 63217


###  HW-1

Write a function **decimalToBinary()** that will take an integer as a parameter.  Then calculates and returns its binary version as another integer. You might make use of your own **power** function.

Then write main appropriately to see the result. 

| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 25     | 11001| 
| 532     |  1000010100  | 
| 5      | 101|

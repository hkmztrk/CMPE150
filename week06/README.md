### W05.HW2


    Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, .... 

    Each number is sum of the previous two numbers except the first two numbers 0 and 1 which are predefined.

Write a program which reads a positive integer number N (smaller than 50), and prints the N.th fibonacci number. 


| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 1     | 0 | 
| 3     | 1 | 
| 7     | 8 | 
| 10     | 34 | 


### W05.HW3

Write a program which reads an integer (smaller than 1000000)  then prints out how many of the digits are odd numbers. 


| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 23423      | 2 | 
| 24602      | 0 | 
| 5          | 1 |


### Q1
Write a program that reads an integer value, and computes the sum of the factorial of each digit . 
The output will be an integer. 

| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 24     | 26 | 
| 122     | 5 | 
| 254     | 146 | 

 ### Q2
 Write a program which reads two integers N and M (both smaller than 15, greater than 1) 
 
     then prints a rectangle with size NxM which has stars (*) at borders, and lines (-) inside. 
     
     
        input: 3 3
        output:   ***
                  *-*
                  ***
        
        input:  4 8
        output:   ********
                  *------*
                  *------*
                  ********

### Q3
 Write a program which takes an integer N as input and prints a right triangle which consists of N many lines 
     
     
        input: 3 
        output:   ***
                   **
                    *
        
        input:  5

                     **
                      *

 ### Homework-1

Write a program that will take integers until the user enters an odd number. Then print the average of the even numbers. 
 - Assume only positive numbers will be entered by the user. 
 
 
| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| 464221     | 3.6 | 
| 22121     | 2 | 
| 1     | 0 | 

 ### Homework-2
 
 Write a program to read integer (N) from the user then print the following N x N square with different symbols.

    input: 4
    output: 
  
            **..
            **..
            $$oo
            $$oo
    
    
    input: 6
    output:
    
            ***...
            ***...
            ***...
            $$$ooo
            $$$ooo
            $$$ooo

 ### Homework-3

Write a function **isPrime()** that checks whether the given number is prime. Function takes a single parameter that is the integer we want to check. 

    Functions returns:
            1 if prime
            0 if not


```c
int isPrime(int number){


}
```

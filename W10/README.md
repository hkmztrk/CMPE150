### Q1 

Read 10 elements from the user and store them in an array. Then find largest and smallest elements of the array.

    input: 7 90 2 4 12 63 11 29 33 1
    output: Max:90 Min:1


### Q2


Write a program which reads an integer N from the user, then reads N integers from the user. Then your program should put these N integers into reverse order and print them to the screen. Assume N is smaller than 50. 


    input: 8
            1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7
    output: 7 8 6 5 3 4 2 1


### Q3


Write a program which reads a sentence from the user (read characters until '\n' appears). Your program then should put this sentence into a char array (assume the sentence will be shorter than 50 characters). 

     Encrypt this sentence by adding +1 to the value of each character. Then print the encrypted version to the screen. 

     Decrypt this sentence by adding -1 to each character, and print the decrypted version again to the screen. 

| INPUT      | OUTPUT    |         
| ---------  |:---------:| 
| Hello Bogazici     | Ifmmp!Cphb{jdj  Hello Bogazici | 
| Programming is fun   | Qsphsbnnjoh!jt!gvo   Programming is fun | 


### Q4

Write a program which reads an integer N from the user, then reads N integers from the user. Compute the sum of the absolute value of the difference between each array element and its index.

    input:   10
            -3   -2   -1    0    1    2    3    4    5    6
    output: 30


### Homework-3

Write a program which reads an integer N from the user, then reads N integers from the user. Then program reads two more integers, low and high. Write a program that finds the largest element in a sub-array of an integer array. The sub-array consists of the array cells indexed between indices low and high, **inclusive**. 

    input:  12
            34   59   69   19   83   25   36   23   36   33 17   99
            3  8 
            
    output: 83
